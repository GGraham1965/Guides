## Delegating Stake through Web Wallet

In the **Guardian Node Holder (Summary)** field, enter “**Summary**” text from GPooL Delegation page. Enter the Amount of THETA you want to stake to this node and click “**Deposit Stake**". Note that you need to delegate **at least 10,000 THETA**.

After reviewing your delegated stake deposit info on the next screen, enter your wallet password, then click "**Confirm & Deposit Stake**".

**Important**: If you stake from a Nano Ledger wallet, you'd need to navigate to the Ethereum app, and make sure that in the settings, "Contract data Allowed" and "Debug data NOT Displayed" are selected.
